# ðŸ”¬ ScanMalware GitHub Action

**Runs Chainguard's [Malcontent](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent) diff between the base commit and PR to detect and report potential malware.**

This composite GitHub Action compares two directories or Git commits, scans for malware risks, and fails the check if specified risk thresholds are exceeded.
